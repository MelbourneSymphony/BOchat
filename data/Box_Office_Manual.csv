Customer and Product Overview,Concession Card Details,"Carer Card - a new kind of concession card issued to the carers of people with accessibility or disability issues. Be careful about distinguishing the Carer Card (concession prices) from the Companion Card (free tickets). The concession applies only at Melbourne Town Hall and Chamber Series performances, similar to the Seniors Card.

Companion Card - issued when someone requires a companion to assist them to attend concerts, the Companion Card concession provides free of charge tickets to the companion. The person they are assisting pays their usual price (very often another concession).

Health Care Card - State Government-issued and means-tested cards that can be used to obtain concession prices at nearly all MSO concerts and subscriptions at Hamer Hall, Melbourne Town Hall, Melbourne Recital Centre and other venues.

Pensioner - State Government-issued and means-tested cards that can be used to obtain concession prices at nearly all MSO concerts and subscriptions at Hamer Hall, Melbourne Town Hall, Melbourne Recital Centre and other venues.

Seniors Cards - issued by the Victorian Government, not means-tested, eligible for MSO Concession pricing only at Melbourne Town Hall and Chamber Series concerts. Works more as a ""proof of age"" or ID card than a proper concession card.

Student - student members can obtain discounted MSO tickets to eligible concerts. The list of eligible concerts is subject to change without notice. Only concerts on the Student tickets listings apply for a student concession. A limit of 2 tickets per student at C reserve and under applies.

Veteran (with Department of Veteran Affairs white or gold card) - State Government-issued and means-tested cards that can be used to obtain concession prices at nearly all MSO concerts and subscriptions at Hamer Hall, Melbourne Town Hall, Melbourne Recital Centre and other venues.

War Widow - State Government-issued and means-tested cards that can be used to obtain concession prices at nearly all MSO concerts and subscriptions at Hamer Hall, Melbourne Town Hall, Melbourne Recital Centre and other venues.

Staff Tickets,Comps ,"Complimentary tickets to MSO performances are available to Staff, Chorus Members and Musicians. Two complimentary tickets are available per date of performance.

Staff, chorus members and musicians can request comp tickets through the comp form availablehttps://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=nlF79e3Lak6ya-0SPleG3l7BgOLArsJLm1LjbcWks3FUMFhHWFBHTlBaOUJDMkZZTFBKR04xVVhRMyQlQCN0PWcuhttps://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=nlF79e3Lak6ya-0SPleG3l7BgOLArsJLm1LjbcWks3FUMlBNU01OWE1IRUhVMkdVTjFUWVRXVjNGVyQlQCN0PWcu&route=shorturl, or by emailing the comp email (comps@mso.com.au) which is handled by Marta. If staff, chorus members or musicians call or email through to request or discuss comps, please direct them to the form or email. We are unable to process comps for staff at the Box Office unless directly authorised. 

Deadlines:
    Tuesday - Friday concerts: 3pm the day before the concert date
    Saturday - Monday concerts: 3pm the Friday before the concert date

Allocation:
    Casual musicians may use the form to request complimentary tickets for concerts they’re performing in. Concert selections will be updated every Monday. 
    Chorus members can receive up to 10 complimentary tickets per year, max of 2 per concert. For any tickets after their allocation is exhausted, they can access the STAFF price type. 

E-tickets will be sent from 2 business days before the concert

#comp #staff "
Staff Tickets,Staff/Chorus Pricing,"Staff pricing is available for performances where comps are not available, or in addition to complimentary tickets. Staff, chorus members and musicians should have a 'Staff' attribute, which will allow the 'Staff' price to be visible when putting together an order. 

The staff pricing discount allows staff to pay one reserve down from the chosen reserve. So, for example, Staff can book in a Premium ticket at an A Reserve price, and so on. There is no discount for D Reserve as it's the lowest reserve. 

As with comps, casual musicians are only able to request staff pricing for performances they are performing in. They won't have a staff attribute, and Orchestra Management or Comps will usually endorse them.

#staff #chorus "
Staff Tickets,Staff Ticket Exchanges,"MSO Staff are entitled to fee-free exchanges. For any exchange where there is a price difference between the ticket values, the difference is payable at the time of the exchange.
    If the new concert/date you select is cheaper than your existing ticket value, the excess value will be absorbed as part of the transaction.
    If the new concert/date is more expensive than your existing ticket value, the additional balance must be paid to finalise the exchange

#staff #feefree #exchanges "
Ticket Change,Exchange Ticket Price Explainer,"When processing an exchange, the new tickets in the exchange order should have a price type that starts with 'Ex' (standing for exchange). That allows us to price match to the appropriate amount. After that, we can use the below guide to find out which price type to use:

Ex S Pkg 
Exchange Standard Package. This is used when the customer exchanging is a Subscriber and the original ticket was not a concession.

Ex S Sng
Exchange Standard Single. This is used when the customer exchanging is a not Subscriber and the original ticket was not a concession.

Ex C Pkg
Exchange Concession Package. This is used when the customer exchanging is a Subscriber and the original ticket was a concession. 

Ex C Sng
Exchange Concession Single. This is used when the customer exchanging is not a Subscriber and the original ticket was a concession. 

Note:
Exchanged tickets should match ticket to ticket. So, for example, if the original order was one standard ticket and one concession, and the customer was not a subscriber, the new tickets in the order would have the Ex S Sng and Ex C Sng price respectively. 

#exchange #subscriber #pricing"
Ticket Change,Change of Mind,"If customers contact us within a day of purchasing, requesting amendment/change/refund of order, we can action under change of mind.

E.g. Customer purchased at 8:57am on Monday, then emails us 12pm Tuesday requesting refund because they booked in error - we can action under ""change of mind"". 

Examples:
    I meant to book five seats together, but one is accidentally in the row behind - help!
    I booked and then told my partner who reminded me we have a wedding that day!
    I meant to book for the Sat 1pm, but booked for the Sat 7:30pm!

Ticket Change,General Venue Exchanges,"If a customer is unable to attend a performance with us, they are able to exchange their ticket for another MSO performance. 

The guidelines for exchanges are:
    The ticket to be exchanged must have originally been sold by the MSO Box Office (and not ACM, etc.) and be moving into a performance also ticketed by the MSO.
    MSO tickets must be exchanged to another performance within the same concert year.
    The MSO Box Office must be contacted at least three hours before the original performance time in order to process an exchange.
    A new order with MOS > Exchange must be used when exchanging a ticket.
    Once started, an Excanage must be finalsed within 3 business days (and if the Exchange is incomplete, all held tickets will be released)

Exchanges are fee-free for:
    Patrons
    MSO Guardians
    Subscribers
    FOTMSO Gold members
    Student members 
    Anyone with Staff price* tickets. 

For everyone else, there is $15 exchange fee per ticket. This should be automatically added to the order when in the Exchange Mode of Sale. 

Jams for Juniors and Classic Kids - single ticket purchases, only one $15 exchange fee is charged per booking. 

In addition to fee's, customers (including subscribers) must pay the difference in ticket cost when exchanging. This includes when a performance is more expensive, when moving to a more expensive day, when moving to a higher reserve, and when there has been a price increase for a performance. We can minimise this cost by moving to a lower reserve, if the customer would like.

UPDATE: If the new ticket is less expensive, this price difference will be absorbed during the exchange and no gift card will be issued
For Larger Price Difference: 
    If the difference is more than $25, once exchange fees have been absorbed if applicable, the BO team can check with TL/SUP about returning this amount to a gift card. 
    If the difference is greater than $75, the BO team can automatically return the amount to a gift card.

Ticket Change,West Gippsland and Frankston Arts Centre Exchanges,"Unlike ACM, MRC, Costa Hall, and many other venues, we neither independently ticket nor have an allocation of tickets for West Gippsland and Frankston Arts Centre performances. 

Because of this, we are unable to exchange tickets between these performances and other MSO performances. 

#exchange #policy #fees #ticket-changes #change "
Ticket Change,Credit Requests / Medical Certificate,"If a customer is unable to attend a performance due to illness and needs more time to exchange then our deadline permits, they are able to receive the value of their tickets as a credit in the form of a gift card. 

Only the value of the tickets can be used towards a credit request. Any fees (transaction/postage fees) or donations processed at initial purchase are not returned for the purposes of credit.

Credit requests have the same rules as an exchange, except:
    Credit requests require a medical certificate to be provided within three business days of the request before it can be finalised. 
    Instead of applying the funds to another performance, the funds are added to a gift card so a new performance can be chosen when the customer is well.

Credit requests have the same guidelines as exchanges:
    The ticket to be credited must have originally been sold by the MSO Box Office (and not ACM, etc.) 
    The MSO Box Office must be contacted at least three hours before the original performance in order to receive a credit.
    A new order with MOS > Exchange must be used when providing a credit.

Credits are fee-free for subscribers. For non-subscribers, there is $15 exchange fee per ticket. This is because customers are still moving between concerts. A credit just extends the time under which they need to book in a new performance. This fee should be automatically added to the order when in the Exchange Mode of Sale, and thus is deducted from the gift card.

Gift Cards are valid for 3 years by law, so customers have 3 years from the time of credit to purchase another performance.

Price Difference

 If the new ticket is less expensive, this price difference will be absorbed during the exchange and no gift card will be issued
For Larger Price Difference: 
    If the difference is more than $25, once exchange fees have been absorbed if applicable, the BO team can check with TL/SUP about returning this amount to a gift card. 
    If the difference is greater than $75, the BO team can automatically return the amount to a gift card.

Ticket Change,Refunds,"There are two situations where tickets are refundable:
    An event is cancelled, rescheduled or significantly changed, as outlined in the https://liveperformance.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LPA-Ticketing-Code-Industry-Code-8th-edition-FINAL.pdf
    The ticket has been purchased within 24 hours of the customer contacting us, as per our Change of Mind policy.

If customers are now no longer able to attend a performance, we can offer an exchange (with fees as applicable), that they pass the tickets on to friends and family, or they donate the cost of the tickets as a tax-deductible donation to the MSO. If they are ill and have a medical certificate, they may receive a credit. 

In rare extenuating circumstances, we may offer a refund or refund to gift card as a gesture of goodwill. In these instances please do not promise a refund, but let the customer know we will escalate their request, CSI, ask for the details in writing (via email) and let a supervisor know.

What if they paid using a Gift Certificate? 
They can only be refunded to another gift certificate. If they paid any additional amount using a credit card, that amount can be refunded to their card. Please contact the customer to check if they wanted a GC for the whole amount rather than a partial refund/partial gift certificate.

Payments,Instalment Plans,"Subscribers who purchase a subscription with us during the subscription period are eligible to pay via instalment plan. 

Important - please make sure you are in MOS: Subscriber and not Subscriber (Web)

Instalment plans allow customers to pay for their subscription over four payments, deducted on the first Friday of every month. At the time of booking, the customer pays: 

    Any fees ($10 instalment fee, plus transaction and postage fees if applicable)
    Contributions

The remaining ticket value is split into 4, with the first payment being deducted overnight following the completion of the transaction.
The remaining 3x payments are deducted over the following 3x months. 

In total, they’ll have 5x transactions:
    Fees – Paid today (manually)
    Payment #1 – Deducted automatically overnight
    Payment #2 – Deducted in 1 month
    Payment #3 – Deducted in 2 months

It'll give you the dates of each payment and tell you if there's a 1 month grace period.

All funds must be paid before a customer's first performance of the year.

We have a grace period of 1 week for instalment payments. If a customer pays for their subscription via instalment payment, and the first Friday of the month is within 1 week of this time, their second payment will be deducted the following month. 

NEW! From 2025, $10 delayed payment fee will be applied to failed instalments - encourage customers to pay on time!

Payments,Instalment Plans - Payment Errors/Failures,"Installment plan payments are automatically deducted on the 1st Friday of each month of their plan.

Errors can occur for various reasons, such as 
    Card has expired or cancelled due to customer issues
    The transaction was declined, likely due to credit limit, daily payment limit has been reached, or the funds are not available on the card

Please action as follows to resolve any installment plan payment issues:
    Nicole will provide a report after the payments are processed on the Friday each month, listing any errors.
    Customers are to be contacted to be made aware of the issue and to follow up resolving this and taking payment. Asana tickets to be made for each one by TL.
    Please do not close the Asana ticket, until the payment is taken, the date should be amended to the following Thursday and the action/contact note updated on the ticket and also in CSI.

First Contact - Advise of payment error (and issue if known eg: CC expired), phone and email as applicable. Expected to correct by the following Thursday to avoid $10 late fee

Second Contact - To be completed by the following Friday, $10 late fee to be added from that Friday if no response. Phone and email customer, advising of second attempt to contact, $10 fee will now be added. Expected to correct the payment error by the following Thursday, to avoid cancellation of the Subscription.

Third Contact - To be completed by the following Friday. If no response to phone call or emails sent, confirm with Alison/Shannon and subscription will be cancelled - with money refund, less fees (including $10 late fee).

NOTE: Changes to installment payment dates can be made if individual circumstances have prevented the payment this month - but only for the one that has failed to process, the next existing scheduled dates remain the same. If you change a payment date, please advise Nicole so she is aware of this and payment can be processed and checked is ok.

Payments,Refund to Cancelled Card (ARN),"It's always best to confirm the validity of the card when issuing a refund. But sometimes funds get caught in limbo if a card account has been closed or a card cancelled (scams/fraud/etc.). In these situations, the funds don't always bounce back to us, and we need to use an Acquirer Reference Number (ARN) to help customer located their refund.

An ARN is a unique number assigned to a credit card transaction as it moves through the payment flow. It can be used by banks to help trace a refund if it appears to be missing. 

Customers will need to give the ARN we provide to their cancelled card’s issuing bank. 

----------------------------------------

Customer Service / Interactions,Scripting to end calls,"Some phrases to assist you end calls with customers, if they are happy to continue chatting after enquiry is complete or when they are indecisive/unprepared or when it is better to move to a follow up email:

Move the call to follow up:
Useful for lengthy enquiries about different subscription series, general indecisiveness on concerts to attend and possibly how to exchange an options etc.

""I'm glad we could talk today! To make sure I have all the information, I'll send you an email with a summary and the next steps for you. Thank you again for your time, and have a good afternoon/evening/weekend"" → Email the summarized information and specific next steps as needed

""I really appreciate you sharing all of that, and I think we've covered/have all the details we need to for now. And will send an email with a summary and the next steps for you. Thank you again for your time, and have a good afternoon/evening/weekend"" → Email the summarized information and specific next steps as needed

""Is there anything else I can help you with before we finish?""

Advise of time constraints:
Useful for getting off a call with a very chatty person, when the initial request has been completed etc

""I really appreciate you sharing all of that. I have to take care of other customers waiting now, but it’s been great helping you today.""

""Thank you so much for your time today. As I don't want to keep our other MSO customers waiting any longer, was there anything else I can help you with before I go??""

*Good for ""urgent enquiries"" - bring it back to the upcoming/current week concert they are looking at.
""Before we finish, let me just double-check: Was there anything else that you needed help with for the concert this week/your tickets for the xxxx concert?"" → Send email follow up with specifics if required.

If something more final and direct is needed

""Thank you for calling today. we have everything we need to... (complete order/exchange etc), and I'll be sending you a confirmation email shortly also. Have a good afternoon/evening"" → Send email with final details as needed

""I’m afraid we’re running out of time, but feel free to email the Box Office if you have any further questions or enquiries""

""So sorry, but I will need to go now. But thank you for your time and the lovely chat. We look forward to seeing you in the concert halls/next concert"" 

Subs renewal - Unprepared caller

Customer Service / Interactions,Access Bookings,"Assisting with accessible bookings are a crucial part of the Box Office's role.

Please check the individual venue in the Venue Information Section for a detailed access information.

#accesibility #access #access-booking #wheelchair "
,Types of Access Requirements,"There are a variety of access requirements customers may have that may impact appropriate/available seating and it is vital that we get as clear a picture as possible. 

These may include, but are not limited to:
·         Limited Mobility/No Stairs
·         Vision Impairment
·         Vertigo
·         Walker
·         Wheelchair/Wheelchair Transfer
·         Aisle Seating
·         Hearing Impairment/Deaf
·         Guide Dog/Support Animal
·         Sensory Sensitivity

Each of these will require different considerations across individual venues.

Why is ascertaining access needs important?

1.       Customer Safety
If someone who struggles to use stairs is seated in the Hamer Hall Balcony and is required to navigate multiple stairs to reach their seats, we increase the risk of injury to themselves or others.

2.       Occupational Safety for Staff
If a customer needs to transfer from a Wheelchair to a seat with assistance. A Staff member could, for example, experience a back injury from lifting/holding a customer during this transfer.

3.       Comfort and Inclusion
MSO concerts should be for everyone! We want to ensure attending the concert hall is enjoyable and as comfortable as possible regardless of someone’s life stage or disability/health status."
,Information Required for Access Bookings,"What do I need to check before I finalise an access booking?

    A reasonable understanding of the type of access requirements a customer has.
    Any price reserve limitations or seating preferences (e.g. Hamer Hall - in a wheelchair but don’t want A Reserve – we likely need to seat in the Stalls)
    Does the person with access requirements have a concession entitlement?
    Does the person with access requirements have a companion card?

Companion card number and expiry must be provided before the booking can be finalised."
,Seating Access Bookings,"IMPORTANT NOTE: MSO does not hold specified access seats outside of Wheelchair/Companion holds: marked as W or 2 for wheelchair and 8 for Companion.

DO:
    Seat them as appropriate based on their requirements and the venue.
    Ensure the companion card seat (if used) is sat in the seat adjacent

DON’T:
     Use Wheelchair hold for non-wheelchair related access bookings (including wheelchair transfers)
    Use additional Wheelchair holds to “keep everyone together” unless all other attendee aside from Wheelchair user and Companion are under 16 years of age. Split seating will likely be required. It would be ideal to sit additional party members in the row directly in front or behind the wheelchair space.

If someone is using a companion card, the companion must be sat adjacent - otherwise they need to pay full-price for the seat.

*A VIC Carer Card is not the same as a Companion Card and does not provide the same discount or have the same requirements."
,Recording Access Requirements - Access CSIs,"Access CSIs must include: 
    Seating location and seat numbers and any seats that need to be removed
    Type of access requirement 
    Any actions or directives given to customer 
Example CSIs in comments

"
,Access CSI Lifecycle,"Where do Access CSIs go after we write them?


MSO:
Ahead of the concert, all access CSIs tagged to a particular performance get pulled into an Access Report from Tessitura.
The Access report gets sent to the relevant Venue Front of House Team with consignment. 

Venue Front of House:
The FOH Manager briefs the ushers who can then ensure the correct seats are removed for wheelchairs and are aware of any other specific customer accommodations that have been offered (such as customer requiring early access). 

Why do we have to put the seat numbers in the Access CSI?
The Access Report doesn't show detailed order information.
If an Access CSI doesn’t contain the seat numbers (or other vital information about the customers requirements), the FOH Manager or ushers would need to check with box office where the customers are seated to ensure the correct preparation is done. 
It may be disruptive or create occupational safety concerns because, for example, there may not be enough staff available for removing seats at the last minute. 
 
After the Concert:
Box Office can close any Access CSIs for past concerts. However, you should always check closed CSIs for historical access requirements. "
Customer Service / Interactions,Feedback and Complaints,"Recording feedback is an important part of maintaining supportive and rigorous policies and procedures. Whether good or bad, all feedback should be CSI'd. These CSI's are passed on to the relevant departments, as per the CSI pathways. 

Record feedback using the CSI path:
Contact Method > Issue Type (Positive/Negative Feedback) > Relevant Department
If the feedback doesn't require follow up, we can then close the CSI.

Negative Feedback and Complaints:

Phone:
    We use the https://melbourneso.sharepoint.com/sites/MarketingSales2/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?ga=1&id=%2Fsites%2FMarketingSales2%2FShared%20Documents%2F3%2E%20Sales%2FTicketing%20Operations%2FBox%20Office%2FBox%20Office%20Resources%2FSignage%2FLEAPS%20Customer%20Call%20Poster%2Epdf&viewid=6dc2bd36%2D78f3%2D41c5%2D9819%2D45da66fc578b&q=LEAP&parent=%2Fsites%2FMarketingSales2%2FShared%20Documents%2F3%2E%20Sales%2FTicketing%20Operations&parentview=7for difficult customer calls. If a call is particularly difficult, you can always tell the customer you'll take some time to problem solve with your supervisor, and call them back. 

Email:
    If the feedback is general in nature, or doesn't require follow up, we can thank the customer for their feedback and CSI the email per above pathway. If the feedback requires follow up and needs to be escalated, we can thank the customer and state we will respond to their feedback, CSI the email, place email in sups folder, and let a Sup or TL know. An email template for both options is available below in the comments.

Positive Feedback:

    For both phone and email, we can thank the customer and CSI the interaction. It's important to CSI positive feedback - particularly if it's regarding your customer service!

Procedures,Merch Orders,"Processing In Person Merch Orders
*Please note merch orders often automatically add a $10 postage fee to the order. Please make sure this fee is removed for in person purchases.

When a customer wishes to purchase merch in person, we can add the merch to the order via the Product Catalogue or QuickSale sections. 

When adding via Product Catalogue, you can select the merch as you would a performance. Merch can be found at the end of the year, as seen here:

https://app.asana.com/app/asana/-/get_asset?asset_id=1207364180642934


The easier way to do this is via QuickSale, which is to the right of the Product Catalogue and Seat Map when you're in an order. You can then select either the Merchandise > Jams for Juniors, or just Merchandise, depending on what you need to find: 

https://app.asana.com/app/asana/-/get_asset?asset_id=1207364180642936

You can then select the kind of merchandise the customer would like to buy. For example, here I'll select a Picnic Rug. At the bottom left you can select the price type needed (full price, subscriber discount, etc). To the bottom right you can then chose to either add to cart (if you're adding more than one item) or add to cart and pay. I've highlighter the options here:

https://app.asana.com/app/asana/-/get_asset?asset_id=1207364180642938

QuickSale often adds the postage fee to merch items, so at this point it's good to check the order total on the right and override the fee if need be. You can then select the appropriate payment method!

Procedures,Return to Sender,"Occasionally posted mail is returned to us, in which case we need to be in touch with the customer to confirm their postal address. 

When processing RTS mail, we need to:

    If so, we'll update their address in Tessi by clicking addresses > adding details of new address > toggling 'primary' when adding the address > clicking save and close in the bottom right. 
    We'll then make the old address inactive by click on the original address > clicking 'inactive' in the top right, clicking 'save and close' in the bottom right.

If we can't get in touch via phone, or the customer doesn't wish to provide a new postal address, we need to:
    Email the customer the RTS email below, if they couldn't be reached by phone
    Add 'Return to Sender' attribute in Attributes

    Companion Cards are a type of concession for people with disability, allowing them to bring a companion to assist them in attending the performance. This concession must be accompanied by a paid ticket. We offer a complimentary ticket under price type 'C Card' for all venues and performances. 

    Seniors Cards are a non-means tested concession and refer to state issued seniors card. We offer a concession price for Melbourne Town Hall performances and Chamber series performances only. 

    Student and Child Price concessions are a different form of concession, relevant to students with a student membership, and children and young adults under 18 respectively.  More information can be found at the relevant manual sections. If student price and/or child price tickets aren't available, they are eligible for the concession price. 

Concession Card details must be placed on file with us prior to ticket purchase. We typically add concession details as an attribute, including type of concession, concession number, and expiry, where relevant. Once a concession has been added on file, we won't need to ask for it again until it expires.

Hi ___
 
Thank you for your feedback. We apologise for any ambiguity caused by online donations module.
 
I have passed on your feedback to management. While, as a non-for-profit, we appreciate donations, we certainly never expect them from our customers.
 
I’m sorry that this dissuaded you from attending our upcoming ____  performance, as it is never our intention to impose additional expenses on customers (particularly considering rising cost of living expenses).
 
I can assure you that we’re in the process of reviewing this, as good business practices and trust from our customers is one of the MSO’s highest priorities.
We hope to see you in the hall again soon.
 
Yours in music,"

Ideas/Things to Add,Update wording around Hearing devices and T-coil/ Telecoil at Plenary,"Hi XX,
We are writing to you regarding your tickets to Man From Snowy River in concert, Sat 3/8/24, 7.30pm.

You are receiving this email as when purchasing tickets, you indicated that someone attending may need the hearing loop. We're just getting in touch to see whether there’s anything we can do to ensure that you have an easy and enjoyable experience with us.
I can confirm that all the seats in The Plenary (the concert venue) is able to access the hearing loop. If you already have a Telecoil (T-coil) hearing aid, then you should be able to tune into the hearing loop yourself. Alternatively, if you would like to borrow a closed loop hearing assistance device, neck loops and portable receivers are available for loan (free of charge), from MCEC Concierge desks on the ground floor. If you wish to loan a device, on the day of the concert please let the MCEC staff know at the concierge desk on the ground floor.
If you would like to go over any further details, please don’t hesitate to reach out via phone on (03) 9929 9600 between 10am – 5pm on weekdays. Alternatively, you can reply to this email, and we'll do whatever we can to accommodate your needs.

Ideas/Things to Add,Access outbounds and CSI updating,"Helloww, I was thinking it would be good to have a set procedure for CSI's for our access out bounds and following up on them. 

I've noticed sometimes when we do out bounds we don't even create a CSI, sometimes we just send emails or call and then delete the special request. 
In some other cases I've also seen that when doing the out bounds we will make a CSI with the 'ISSUE TYPE'  under 'Access requirements' and then there will be a long list of updates with different dates and different attendants, until finally there will be a decision whether or not we do or don't need for ACM to prepare something. 
I have also noticed when starting off with a CSI under 'Access requirements' from the beginning. That sometimes when we get an email confirmation from the customer of what arrangement they will need, that an attendant will simply just delete the email but not update the CSI or even  reply the customer, as it might seem that there is already an access CSI prepared and it is assumed that the arrangements are noted. 

I was wondering if it might be advisable and more clear for both our team and ACM if when doing the out bounds we always could start off with a CSI with an 'ISSUE TYPE' under 'Note/Comment' and that's where we can write up our follow ups, and then only once its confirmed the customer has an actual need for us to prepare additional arrangements then we make the fresh and clean Access CSI. 

Would be good to clear up what is the best procedure for us all to follow. (Hope I've made sense)"

This is an incorrect way to hold seats – use an Unpaid order and a Hold Until CSI

The only scenario where we should be putting seats on (+) holds is when the seats are stuck in a customer's cart on the website and there's a reasonable chance they'll get nabbed in the next 10 minutes. You should be staying on the call with the customer while you're using the hold and releasing as you place the seats. 

EVEN THEN, we have to release the holds once the transaction is finalised"

This can occur from right after they booked to days after. If this is the case, we can automatically refund this donation if that's what they desire and does not require a formal email or management clearance. We have created an email template for people who didn't accidentally donate but are complaining about the principle (in comments).  For complaints that didn't donate/weren't refunded, please log them as a Negative Feedback CSI with Website subtype.

    Access Holds for Wheelchair spaces - if our allocation of access seats have been used, ask Marta about those that have been consigned to sell through ACM, and these will be requested from them - can take a little time, so if the customer is on the phone - we will absolutely assist, but will need to call them back, when the order is all set up.
    If the seat is Blue on Tessi, always check the HOLDS tab to see the detail on the hold.
